  <p id="paragraph">While working at CERN in Switzerland, the English physicist Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for "a large hypertext database with typed links". Although the proposal attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing his system on a newly acquired NeXT workstation. He considered several names, including Information Mesh, The Information Mine, and Mine of Information, but settled on World Wide Web.</p>
